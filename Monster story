// note from Rowan: which monster you get is determined with the value of mGen and 
// the level. To create an if statement that corectly identify's the monster you need
// basic monsters level = 0, advanced monsters level = 1,or legendary monsters level = 2
// and mGen = the location of the monster you want in the monster array 
// so for example to get the big rat (a level 0 monster at location 0 in array) use: 
// if(level = 0 && mGen = 0){"your big rat code here"}
// to get the War Robot (a level 2 monster at location 4 in the array) use:
// if(level = 2 && mGen = 4){"Your War Robot goes here"}
// mGen is randomized when the MonStat is called on to make a monster
// mGen is a value between (0-4) and it controls which monster is generated.
